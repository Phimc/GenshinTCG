_A project try to materialize the Genshin TCG_    
Genius Invokation TCG (GenshinTCG) is an updated version 3.3 of the Genshin Impact.    
Players collect cards to build a deck and go toe-to-toe with various opponents at the table.     
This project will continously focus on bringing the game to real life.

## Updated 2022/12/09
The preliminary plan of this project is:    
The game system is centered on a mobile APP.    
Record role information on the APP and show it in a form close to the original.    
Realize the basic element reaction system in Genshin Impact in the APP.    
Use cards with NFC chips or bar codes to achieve players' hand cards.   
Players can use their hand cards by approaching the NFC enabled mobile phone or using the front camera to scan the barcode.
